# Netflix-App
<h2> Android App</h1>
<p> A movie app ðŸ“±ðŸŽ¦like Netflix that has a regester form and I had used 'google' text field to make the design more professional </p>
<p> The application has a splash screen</p>
<p> The application has show datials screen to make the user able to see some datials about the movie like movie poster , rate , actors, or add the movie to the favourits</p>
<p> I had used recycler view to make user able to browse movies with a good way and sqlite database to store user's favourite movies, and store users data</p>
<p> The user can search in the movies, can add movies that he want to favourite movies</p>
